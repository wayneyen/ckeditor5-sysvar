## Developing the package

To read about the CKEditor 5 framework, visit the [CKEditor5 documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/index.html).

## Available scripts

Npm scripts are a convenient way to provide commands in a project. They are defined in the `package.json` file and shared with other people contributing to the project. It ensures that developers use the same command with the same options (flags).

All the scripts can be executed by running `yarn run <script>`. Pre and post commands with matching names will be run for those as well.

The following scripts are available in the package.

### `start`

Starts a HTTP server with the live-reload mechanism that allows previewing and testing plugins available in the package.

When the server has been started, the default browser will open the developer sample. This can be disabled by passing the `--no-open` option to that command.

Examples:

```bash
# Starts the server and open the browser.
yarn run start

# Disable auto-opening the browser.
yarn run start --no-open
```

### `test`

Allows executing unit tests for the package, specified in the `tests/` directory. The command accepts the following modifiers:

* `--coverage` &ndash; to create the code coverage report,
* `--watch` &ndash; to observe the source files (the command does not end after executing tests),
* `--source-map` &ndash; to generate source maps of sources,
* `--verbose` &ndash; to print additional webpack logs.

Examples:

```bash
# Execute tests.
yarn run test

# Generate code coverage report after each change in the sources.
yarn run test --coverage --test
```

### `lint`

Runs ESLint, which analyzes the code (all `*.js` files) to quickly find problems.

Examples:

```bash
# Execute eslint.
yarn run lint
```

### `stylelint`

Similar to the `lint` task, stylelint analyzes the CSS code (`*.css` files in the `theme/` directory) in the package.

Examples:

```bash
# Execute stylelint.
yarn run stylelint
```

### `dll:build`

Creates a DLL-compatible package build which can be loaded into an editor using [DLL builds](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/development/dll-builds.html).

Examples:

```bash
# Build the DLL file that is ready to publish.
yarn run dll:build

# Build the DLL file and listen to changes in its sources.
yarn run dll:build --watch
```

### `dll:serve`

Creates a simple HTTP server (without the live-reload mechanism) that allows verifying whether the DLL build of the package is compatible with the CKEditor 5 [DLL builds](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/development/dll-builds.html).

Examples:

```bash
# Starts the HTTP server and opens the browser.
yarn run dll:serve
```
